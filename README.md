RentalBot is a Discord bot that allows users to track their bot rentals in a much more convenient place besides a spreadsheet or other software.
Users simply use the command `!rental` and it will begin prompting them with questions such as `What bot is being rented?`, `Who's renting it?`, `How long is the rental?`, `How much is the rental?`. The bot will then gather all of the information and display in a nice embed. You will then be able to view and delete your rentals using the command `!view`. To delete a rental, simply click the trashcan emoji underneath of your desired rental.

IN PROGRESS:
- Database integration
- `!view` command
- Delete rental option
- Custom bot pictures instead of green checkmark upon completion

FINISHED:
- Question prompts
- Final embed display
